### We Are All Pokémon Trainers (WAAPT)
A play-by-post roleplay taking place in a version of the Pokémon universe that meshes the games' canon with the anime, TCG, spinoff games, and various manga in the franchise.
Running since February 2011, it's one of the largest RPs on TV Tropes.

### The Pokédex - Extended Fanon Edition (PEFE)
A project to write expanded versions of the Pokédex entries in the style of actual research reports.
The entries themselves are articles on the TVTropes wiki, but the coordination and drafts are done in this thread.

### Wild Pokémon In The Big City (Big City/BC)
A play-by-post RP that ran from February 2011 to January 2012.
Quoting from the Signup thread:
>It's an RP about wild Pokemon in a big city.
>You can pick your species, what you do in the city (you can be part of or run a small gang) what clothes you wear (if you wear clothes)
>and the plot is basically survive, interact with one another or temporary OCs,
>and to band together to fight against a gang of Pokemon that wants the backstreets for themselves.

### Pokémon: The RP
